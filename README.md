# Smashing Magazine Homepage Design Teardown

A grayscale heatmap of the [smashingmagazine.com](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/) homepage's **Visual Hierarchy**.

In this project I showcase my **UX**, **Grid Design**, and **Typography** Skills.

I did this Project as part of The Odin Project's [Curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/html5-and-css3/lessons/design-teardown)
